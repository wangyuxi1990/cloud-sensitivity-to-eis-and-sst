Annual-mean time series of low cloud cover, EIS and SST over the period 1900-1999 were extracted from historical simulations done with 18 CMIP5 models. These variables are averaged over each of the 5 oceanic regions dominated by low clouds.

Regression analyses were performed to compute the sensitivity of low cloud cover to either EIS or SST. The correlation between low cloud cover with either EIS or SST is also calculated. Current implementation is in NCL.
