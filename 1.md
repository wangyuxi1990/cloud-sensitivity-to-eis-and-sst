# Calculating the sensitivities of LCC to EIS and SST #

# Introduction #

To understand the spread in LCC response to climate change in 18 CMIP5 models, we hypothesize that the estimated inversion strength (EIS) and sea surface temperature (SST) are the most important factors shaping the LCC response. We then quantify the contribution of EIS or SST to simulated LCC changes by the product of anthropogenic changes in EIS or SST and a local LCC sensitivity to it. Below, we describe how the sensitivities are calculated.


# Details #

EIS and SST sensitivities are computed based on simulated interannual climate variability in the 20th-century as follows. First, we compute the annual-mean time series of LCC, EIS and SST for each of the five regions dominated by low clouds. Then, we remove the long-term trend from each time series. Finally, we regress the LCC time series onto either the EIS or SST series. A complicating factor is that EIS and SST time series are not independent. To eliminate the potential ambiguity of EIS-SST covariance in the EIS sensitivity estimate, we remove the components of LCC and EIS variations that are linearly related to SST variations by regression analysis before then regression LCC on to EIS. Likewise, we remove the components of LCC and SST variations that are linearly related to EIS variations before estimating the SST slope. It is documented in [Qu et al. (2013)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-013-1945-z.)
